        "college": "Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India",
        "abstract": "NTRU is one of the earliest lattice-based cryptographic schemes, with its security conjectured to rely on hard lattice problems. Over the years, numerous variants of NTRU have been proposed over different algebraic rings. This tutorial aims to provide a unified perspective that generalizes these variants within a common framework. We begin by revisiting the original NTRU construction proposed by Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman, and then extend the discussion to its formulations over various algebraic rings. The tutorial further examines how these diverse schemes can be viewed as special cases of a more general group-ring-based NTRU framework. Finally, we conclude with an overview of cryptanalytic results and their implications for the security and design of NTRU-based systems.",
